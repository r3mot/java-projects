<p align="center">This project was developed as part of my Software Development course.</br>
While this was a University project, I attempted to go beyond the scope of the requirements</br> and take this 
as an opportunity for growth. </p>

## :brain: What I Learned

This project forced me to step out of my comfort zone and try new things. </br>
As I was fairly new to programming at the time of development, there was definetely</br> a learning curve. 
Most notably- building out my backend. </br></br>From learning how to use JDBC drivers to connect
to the SQLite database, </br>creating database queries, and using the data in meaningful ways- it was no easy task.
In hindsight, I could have opted to use something like Spring Boot to help with my backend. <br/>
While this would have made things easier, building from the ground up has given</br>
me a clearer understanding of what is going on behind the scenes. </br>

As for managing the codebase, the OOP nature of the project proved useful.</br>
My knowledge of datastructures was tested when I implemented my own ArrayList</br>
to meet my very specific needs.</br>

</br></br>
## :adhesive_bandage: Todo 

At the time of developing this project, I had merely a few months of programming experience under my belt. </br> 
A lot of the features were "learn as you go". Here's how I plan to address some of the failures of the project

* Rework the backend to use proper CRUD operations
* Revisit the CSS styling 
* Improve relational database
    * Merge database to another platform (potentially postgres)
